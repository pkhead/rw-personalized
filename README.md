## Features
No, this mod doesn't actually personalize your Rain World experience using state-of-the-art A.I (...yet).
I'm just having too much fun writing this readme. In actuality, it just does
various miscellaneous things. Current features include:
- Blue Lizards, Caramel Lizards, and Grapple Worms have a chance to be "shiny" (i.e., differently colored)
- You may encounter "Larry" (configurable through Spawn Chance in the Remix config)

In the future I may add more funny miscellaneous things.

## Building
First, this project will reference assemblies from the Rain World install directory. I've set some
fields in the .csproj file which I believe will copy the required references instead of referencing
them directly. As such, you must set an environment variable "RainWorldDir" to the Rain World install directory before
building.

PowerShell (Windows):
```powershell
# if installed through Steam
$env:RainWorldDir = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Rain World"
```
Bash (Linux):
```bash
# i don't have steam on linux i just searched this up
export RainWorldDir="~/.steam/root/steamapps/common/Rain World"
```

Then to build the project, run these commands:
```bash
# install cake build tool for this repository
# (only needs to be run once)
dotnet tool restore

# build the project
dotnet cake
```
Once executed, there will be a folder called `out` containing the mod contents,
and a copy of `out` will be put in the Rain World mod folder.

Running `dotnet cake --target=Build` instead will not put the mod into the Rain World mod folder.
