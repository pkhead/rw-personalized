    Features/Concepts

- The spirits will be angry when you kill Larry
- passage music is so fitting for the "What" meme where they play earthbound sanctuary guardians
- make It spawn when you are done talking to pebbles
  then pebbles acknowledges the existence of It
- "stalker" behavior for It
    - "It" has a chance of spawning at a random place within the room, and will stand there until being seen,
      then shortly afterwards pop out of existence
- zombie creatures (maybe larry is an example of a "zombified" slugpup)
- scp096-ass creature
    - faint picture of its face engulfs whole screen before it actually spawns?
      (my friend suggested this, but i'm not completely on board with this)
- Hell
- tameable spiders
- sometimes the cycle will start at night, where scary stuff will happen
- Sometimes, there will be no creatures or food that spawn in a cycle, and some
  scary bg noise starts playing after a while and ramps up.
  then when you enter some random room, the music will stop and there will be
  a super scary sc096-ass creature waiting for you (no jumpscare)
  - creature has camouflage? but player will be able to notice when it moves
- sometimes an entity will try to communicate with the player through unorthodox methods
- creature that acts friendly or aggressive by random chance
