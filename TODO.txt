x - done (will then be removed)
= - in progress

- play random music cues for no reason
- remove moreslugcats requirement

= poisonous green bluefruit
    - make vomiting happen randomly while poisoned
    - unintrusive vomit cue a few seconds before player actually vomits
- need more random features

- make It spawn when you are done talking to pebbles
  then pebbles acknowledges the existence of It
- "stalker" behavior for It
- violencing It stuns it for a bit
- idea: remix config tabs for each level of spookiness
- zombie creatures
