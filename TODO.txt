- play random music cues for no reason
x shiny bluefruit (sort of like emerald's tweaks and features)

x don't chase players that are in pipes
x can sometimes crash when choosing entrance
- "stalker" behavior for It
- violencing It stuns it for a bit
- idea: remix config tabs for each level of spookiness
