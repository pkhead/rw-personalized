I\u0027m just having too much fun writing this description. In actuality, it just does various miscellaneous things. Current features include:\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Blue Lizards, Caramel Lizards, and Grapple Worms have a chance to be \u0022shiny\u0022 (i.e., differently colored)\r\n[*] Shiny bluefruit which gives you more food pips if eaten\r\n[*] You may encounter \u0022Larry\u0022 (configurable through Spawn Chance in the Remix config)\r\n[/list]\r\nIn the future I may add more funny miscellaneous things.",
